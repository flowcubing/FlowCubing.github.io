        <h1>2020 Cubing Timeline</h1>
        <p>This project started as an idea in March 2020, and is now finally realized. Inspired by the <a href="https://static.miraheze.org/2b2twiki/5/5a/2b2t_Timeline.jpg">2b2t timeline</a> by Sato86,
            I wanted to create a timeline about speedcubing. So, after many weeks, I have created the 2020 Speedcubing Timeline. It features most of the major events that influenced speedcubing.
            To make this timeline, I used a lot of different sources. I have a bibliography at the bottom of the page. This may not be the most accurate, but it was fun to make. Let me know what you think.
